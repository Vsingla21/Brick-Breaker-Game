# Brick-Breaker-Game
This project is a classic brick breaker game we have seldom played on our mobile phones. The ball breaks the aligned bricks as soon as it touches them and bounces back on the moving platform below which is under the user's control. Prevent the ball from falling anywhere except the platform to win. The game is developed and coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
